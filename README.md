# AmongUsController
Wanted to play among us with a controller? Now you can! 
This project aims to provide a reasonably good way to play the game Among Us with a controller by mapping the keyboard controls onto the controller.

## Controls
LJoystick / DPAD: Movement
ZL / L: Kill
ZR / R: Use
Circle: Report Body
Square: Map
Start: Menu

Also, to use this, you will need the PC version since it uses keyboard commands, so those need to be enabled.
